;; Exercise 2.2: Consider the problem of representing line segments in a plane. Each segment is
;; represented as a pair of points: a starting point and an ending point. Define a constructor
;; make-segment and selectors start-segment and end-segment that define the representation of
;; segments in terms of points. Furthermore, a point can be represented as a pair of numbers: the x
;; coordinate and the y coordinate. Accordingly, specify a constructor make-point and selectors
;; x-point and y-point that define this representation. Finally, using your selectors and
;; constructors, define a procedure midpoint-segment that takes a line segment as argument and
;; returns its midpoint (the point whose coordinates are the average of the coordinates of the
;; endpoints). To try your procedures, youâ€™ll need a way to print points:

(define (print-point p)
  (newline)
  (display "(")
  (display (x-point p))
  (display ",")
  (display (y-point p))
  (display ")"))

(define (make-segment start end)
  (cons start end))

(define (start-segment x)
  (car x))

(define (end-segment x)
  (cdr x))

(define (make-point x y)
  (cons x y))

(define (x-point point)
  (car point))

(define (y-point point)
  (cdr point))

(define (midpoint segment)
  (let ((start (start-segment segment))
        (end (end-segment segment)))
       (make-point (/ (+ (x-point start)(x-point end) 2))
              (/ (+ (y-point start) (y-point end)) 2))))

(define first-point (make-point 2 0))
(define second-point (make-point 0 2))

(define segment (make-segment first-point second-point))

(define the-average-point (midpoint segment))
(print-point the-average-point)
