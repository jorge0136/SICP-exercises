; Exercise 2.2: Consider the problem of representing line segments in a plane. Each segment is
; represented as a pair of points: a starting point and an ending point. Define a constructor
; make-segment and selectors start-segment and end-segment that define the representation of
; segments in terms of points. Furthermore, a point can be represented as a pair of numbers: the x
; coordinate and the y coordinate. Accordingly, specify a constructor make-point and selectors
; x-point and y-point that define this representation. Finally, using your selectors and
; constructors, define a procedure midpoint-segment that takes a line segment as argument and
; returns its midpoint (the point whose coordinates are the average of the coordinates of the
; endpoints). To try your procedures, youâ€™ll need a way to print points:

; (define (print-point p) (newline) (display "(") (display (x-point p)) (display ",") (display
; (y-point p)) (display ")"))

#lang sicp

(define (make-point x y)
  (cons x y))

(define (x-point point)
  (car point))

(define (y-point point)
  (cdr point))

(define (make-segment start-point end-point)
  (cons start-point end-point))

(define (start-segment segment)
  (car segment))

(define (end-segment segment)
  (cdr segment))

(define (print-point p)
  (newline)
  (display "(")
  (display (x-point p))
  (display ",")
  (display (y-point p))
  (display ")"))

(define (find-middle n1 n2)
  (+ n1 (/ (- n2 n1) 2)))

(define (midpoint-segment segment)
  (let ((start-x (x-point (start-segment segment)))
        (start-y (y-point (start-segment segment)))
        (end-x (x-point (end-segment segment)))
        (end-y (y-point (end-segment segment))))
        (print-point (make-point
                      (find-middle start-x end-x)
                      (find-middle start-y end-y)))))

(midpoint-segment (make-segment (make-point 2 2) (make-point 4 4))) ; =>(3,3)
