; Exercise 2.33: Fill in the missing expressions to complete the following definitions of some
; basic list-manipulation operations as accumulations:

(define (accumulate op initial sequence)
  (if (null? sequence)
      initial
      (op (car sequence)
          (accumulate op
                      initial
                      (cdr sequence)))))

(define (map p sequence)
  (accumulate (lambda (x y)
                (cons (p x) y))
              nil
              sequence))

(define (square x) (* x x))

(map square (list 1 2 3))

(define (append seq1 seq2)
  (accumulate cons seq2 seq1))

(append (list 1 2 3) (list 6 5 7))

(define (length sequence)
  (accumulate (lambda (x y)
                (+ 1 y))
                  0 sequence))

(length (list 1 2 3))
