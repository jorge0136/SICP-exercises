;; Exercise 1.44: The idea of smoothing a function is an important concept in signal processing. If
;; f is a function and dx is some small number, then the smoothed version of f is the function whose
;; value at a point x is the average of f(xâˆ’dx), f(x), and f(x+dx). Write a procedure smooth that
;; takes as input a procedure that computes f and returns a procedure that computes the smoothed f.
;; It is sometimes valuable to repeatedly smooth a function (that is, smooth the smoothed function,
;; and so on) to obtain the n-fold smoothed function. Show how to generate the n-fold smoothed
;; function of any given function using smooth and repeated from Exercise 1.43.
