;; Exercise 1.24: Modify the timed-prime-test procedure of Exercise 1.22 to use fast-prime? 
;; (the Fermat method), and test each of the 12 primes you found in that exercise.
;; Since the Fermat test has Î˜(logn) growth, how would you expect the time to test primes near 
;; 1,000,000 to compare with the time needed to test primes near 1000? Do your data bear this out?
;; Can you explain any discrepancy you find?
