# SICP
*Structure and Interpretation of Computer Program*

* [MIT Course from 2005](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/)
* [edX Course from 2014](https://edge.edx.org/courses/uc-berkeley/cs61as-1x/SICP/about)

## Getting Started

Before you can complete the SICP exercises you'll need to have these dependencies installed on your machine:

* [DrRacket](https://racket-lang.org/) with the [SICP extension](https://docs.racket-lang.org/sicp-manual/Installation.html). This will install the dialect of lisp used in the book.
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### How to Complete the Exercises

1. `git clone` this repository locally.
2. Create your own branch of this repository. `git checkout -b <branch_name>`.
3. Complete the exercise prompts on your own branch.

### Flashcards

I created an [Anki flashcard deck](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1088398983) that I will be adding to over time.
