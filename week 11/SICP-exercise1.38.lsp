;; Exercise 1.38: In 1737, the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler published a memoir De Fractionibus
;; Continuis, which included a continued fraction expansion for e-2, where e is the base of the
;; natural logarithms. In this fraction, the Ni are all 1, and the Di are successively 1, 2, 1, 1,
;; 4, 1, 1, 6, 1, 1, 8, .... Write a program that uses your cont-frac procedure from Exercise 1.37
;; to approximate e, based on Eulerâ€™s expansion.



;; index = 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
;; value = 1 2 1 1 4 1 1 6 1 1 8
